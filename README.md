2023F CS2910 Programming Project Specification

# Assignment Description:
This is a simulation for a board game called monopoly, following 
the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD), applying object-oriented design (OOD) 
principles, and reflecting on the use of generative AI tools.For 
implementation phases, I will emphasize object-oriented design, write failing tests, 
implement code to pass the tests, and refactoring as needed.Additionally, I will have the opportunity to reflect 
on my use of generative AI tools in the project.

# Objectives
- Develop a well-documented board game simulation using Test-Driven Development (TDD) and 
object-oriented design (OOD) principles.
- Create multiple player strategies, each designed by your team to address specific game scenarios.
- Integrate player strategies into the game simulation.
- Generate a report with data and analyses comparing player strategies' performance.
- Create a reflective assessment of the use of generative AI tools during the project.

**Tasks:**
- Select a board game.This board game choice will sufficient structure that you have at least 1 collection 
(aggregation relationship) and one generalization (inheritance relationship) hierarchy, adhering to object-oriented 
design principles.   
## Phase 2: Player Classes and Strategies

Using the class structure from **Phase 1** create a set of player classes and choose 3 strategies and implement the players
making choices. 

**Tasks:**
-	Develop at least three distinct player strategies for the game.
-	Apply object-oriented design principles to design cohesive player and related classes.
-	Write failing tests for each player strategy to ensure they make valid and effective moves.
-	Implement the player strategy code.
- Integrate the player strategies into the game simulation while maintaining object-oriented design principles.
